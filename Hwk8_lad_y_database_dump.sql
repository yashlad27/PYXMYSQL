But what about the company that is not born\nwith great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even\nbad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study \nFor years,\nthis question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there\ncompanies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or\nworse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the\nuniversal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to\ngo from good to great? The Standards \nUsing tough benchmarks,\nCollins and his research team identified a set of elite companies\nthat made the leap to great results and sustained those results\nfor at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-\nto-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat\nthe general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen\nyears, better than twice the results delivered by a composite\nindex of the world\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola,\nIntel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons \nThe research\nteam contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully\nselected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap\nfrom good to great. What was different? Why did one set of\ncompanies become truly great performers while the other set\nremained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the\nhistories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After\nsifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of\ninterviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants\nof greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others\ndon\'t. The Findings\n The findings of the Good to Great study\nwill surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area\nof management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5\nLeaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of\nleadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept\n(Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great\nrequires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of\nDiscipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an\nethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great\nresults. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think\ndifferently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the\nDoom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching\nrestructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.Some\nof the key concepts discerned in the study, comments Jim Collins,\nfly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite\nfrankly, upset some people.

It worked\nsometimes.I tried setting audacious big goals. I almost always\nfailed them.I tried to make changes last. They didn\'t.Like most\npeople who try to change and fail, I assumed that I was the\nproblem.\n\nThen one afternoon--after another failed attempt to\nget motivated to exercise--I (accidentally) started my first mini\nhabit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned\ninto a full workout. I was shocked. This stupid idea wasn\'t\nsupposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this\nstrategy continued for months (and to this day).\n\nI had to\nconsider that maybe I wasn\'t the problem in those 10 years of\nmediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were\nineffective, despite being oft-repeated as the way to change in\ncountless books and blogs.\n\nMy suspicions were correct.\n\nIs\nThere A Scientific Explanation For This?\nAs I sought\nunderstanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had\nanswers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the\nscience--which you\'ll find peppered throughout Mini Habits--\nwe\'ve been doing it all wrong.\n\nYou can succeed without the\nguilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such\nstrategies as getting motivated, New Year\'s Resolutions, or even\njust doing it. In fact, you need to stop using those strategies\nif they aren\'t giving you great results.\n\nMost popular\nstrategies don\'t work well because they require you to fight\nagainst your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It\'s\nonly when you start playing by your brain\'s rules and taking\nyour human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to\ndo--that you can achieve lasting change.\n\nWhat\'s A Mini\nHabit?\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you\nforce yourself to do every day; its too small to fail nature\nmakes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-\nbuilding strategy. You will have no choice but to believe in\nyourself when you\'re always moving forward.\n\nThe barrier to\nthe first step is so low that even depressed or stuck people can\nfind early success and begin to reverse their lives right away.\nAnd if you think one push-up a day is too small to matter, I\'ve\ngot one heck of a story for you!\n\nAim For The First Step\nThey\nsay when you aim for the moon, you\'ll land among the stars.\nWell, that doesn\'t make sense, as the moon is closer than the\nstars. I digress. \n\nThe message is that you should aim very\nhigh and even if you fall short, you\'ll still get somewhere.\nI\'ve found the opposite to be true in regards to productivity\nand healthy behaviors. When you aim for the moon, you won\'t do\nanything because it\'s too far away. But when you aim for the\nstep in front of you, you might keep going and reach the moon.\n\nnI\'ve used the Mini Habits strategy to get into the best shape\nof my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words. It\nstarted from requiring one push-up from myself every day. How\nridiculous is that? Not so ridiculous when you consider the\nscience of the brain, habits, and willpower.\n\nThe Mini Habits\nsystem works because it\'s how our brains are designed to\nchange.\n\nNote: This book isn\'t for eliminating bad habits\n(some principles could be useful for breaking habits). Mini\nHabits is a strategy to create permanent healthy habits in:\nexercise, writing, reading, thinking positively, meditating,\ndrinking water, eating healthy foods, etc.\n\nLasting change\nwon\'t happen until you take that first step into a strategy that\nworks.

Happy aims to reclaim\nhappiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life,\nin all their transient glory.

It had been an\nextraordinary career.When he first started out in the late\nsixties, Billy played the banjo in the folk clubs of Scotland.\nBetween songs, he would improvise a bit, telling anecdotes from\nthe Clyde shipyard where he\'d worked. In the process, he made\nall kinds of discoveries about what audiences found funny, from\nhis own brilliant mimes to the power of speaking irreverently\nabout politics or explicitly about sex. He began to understand\nthe craft of great storytelling. Soon the songs became shorter\nand the monologues longer, and Billy quickly became recognised as\none of the most exciting comedians of his generation.Billy\'s\nroutines always felt spontaneous. He never wrote scripts, always\ncreating his comedy freshly on stage in the presence of a live\naudience. A brilliant comic story might be subsequently\ndiscarded, adapted or embellished. A quick observation or short\nanecdote one night, could become a twenty-minute segment by the\nnext night of a tour.Billy always brought a beautiful sense of\nthe absurd to his shows as he riffed on his family, hecklers,\nswimming in the North Sea or naked bungee jumping. But his comedy\ncan be laced with anger too. He hates pretentiousness and calls\nout hypocrisy wherever he sees it. His insights about the human\ncondition have shocked many people, while his unique talent and\nstartling appearance on stage gave him license to say anything he\ndamn well pleased about sex, politics or religion. Billy got away\nwith it because he has always had the popular touch. His comedy\nspans generations and different social tribes in a way that few\nothers have ever managed.Tall Tales and Wee Stories brings\ntogether the very best of Billy\'s storytelling for the first time\nand includes his most famous routines including, The Last Supper,\nJojoba Shampoo, Incontinence Pants and Shouting at Wildebeest.\nWith an introduction and original illustrations by Billy\nthroughout, it is an inspirational, energetic and riotously funny\nread, and a fitting celebration of our greatest ever\ncomedian.',336,1,NULL,'Hachette UK','2019-10-17'),('9781529404937','Ask A Footballer','\'Ask a Footballer is a fine\nread, showcasing how an unassuming man has forged success,\nwinning the Premier League twice, the FA Cup and the Champions\nLeague\' Matthew Syed, The TimesEver wondered what it\'s REALLY\nlike to be a Premier League footballer?\n\nMy name is James\nMilner and I\'m not a Ribena-holic.\n\nLet me share insights into\nwhat it\'s like being a professional footballer, across my\ndifferent experiences with Leeds United, Newcastle, Aston Villa,\nManchester City and now Liverpool (not forgetting a six-match\nloan spell at Swindon).

These four books will give you as complete a view on the\nart of war as you can attain. This is the most important book\never written about warfare and conflict. Lionel Giles\'\ntranslation is the definitive edition and his commentary is\nindispensable. The Art of War can be used and adapted in every\nfacet of your life. This book explains when and how to go to war,\nas well as when not to. Learn how to win any conflict whether it\nbe on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Although Carl von\nClausewitz participated in many military campaigns, he was\nprimarily a military theorist interested in the examination of\nwar. On War is the West\'s premier work on the philosophy of war.\nOther soldiers before him had written treatises on various\nmilitary subjects, but none undertook a great philosophical\nexamination of war on the scale of Clausewitz\'s. On War is\nconsidered to be the first modern book of military strategy. This\nis due mainly to Clausewitz\' integration of political, social,\nand economic issues as some of the most important factors in\ndeciding the outcomes of a war. It is one of the most important\ntreatises on strategy ever written, and continues to be required\nreading at many military academies. Niccolo Machiavelli\nconsidered this book his greatest achievement. Here you will\nlearn how to recruit, train, motivate, and discipline an army.\nYou will learn the difference between strategy and tactics.\nMachiavelli does a masterful job of breaking down and analyzing\nhistoric battles. This book of military knowledge belongs\nalongside Sun-Tzu and Clausewitz on every book shelf. Antoine-\nHenri Jomini was the most celebrated writer on the Napoleonic art\nof war. Jomini was present at most of the most important battles\nof the Napoleonic Wars. His writing, therefore, is the most\nauthoritative on the subject. The art of war, as generally\nconsidered, consists of five purely military branches,-viz.:\nStrategy, Grand Tactics, Logistics, Engineering, and Tactics. A\nsixth and essential branch, hitherto unrecognized, might be\ntermed Diplomacy in its relation to War. Although this branch is\nmore naturally and intimately connected with the profession of a\nstatesman than with that of a soldier, it cannot be denied that,\nif it be useless to a subordinate general, it is indispensable to\nevery general commanding an army. -Antoine-Henri\nJomini',667,1,NULL,'Simon and Schuster','2013-04-29'),('9781627931991','The Law of Success in Sixteen Lessons','The Law\nof Success was a precursor to Napoleon Hill\'s Think and Grow\nRich.

While business administration professionals tend to\nconsider information technology as a subordinate aspect in\nbusiness process management for experts to handle, by contrast\ncomputer science professionals often consider business goals and\norganizational regulations as terms that do not deserve much\nthought but require the appropriate level of abstraction.Matthias\nWeske argues that all communities involved need to have a common\nunderstanding of the different aspects of business process\nmanagement. To this end, he details the complete business process\nlifecycle from the modeling phase to process enactment and\nimprovement, taking into account all different stakeholders\ninvolved. After starting with a presentation of general\nfoundations and abstraction models, he explains concepts like\nprocess orchestrations and choreographies, as well as process\nproperties and data dependencies. Finally, he presents both\ntraditional and advanced business process management\narchitectures, covering, for example, workflow management systems,\nservice-oriented architectures, and data-driven approaches.
